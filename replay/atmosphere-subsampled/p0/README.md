This is essentially a "Hello World" setup to make sure things are working
properly.
The general steps are:
1. Create the data using the yamls in the [data/](./data/)
   directory
2. Train the model using the yamls in the [training/](./training)
   directory
3. Run inference using the trained model weights with the yamls in the
   [inference](./inference) directory
