# Preprocessing

The yaml files here create separate datasets for training, validation, and
testing, respectively.

Note that the "directories" section of each yaml file needs to be prepended with
a user-specific directory, for example on Perlmutter, we could use something
like:

```yaml
directories:
  zarr: /pscratch/sd/t/timothys/anemoi-house/replay/atmosphere-subsampled/p0/training.zarr
  cache: /pscratch/sd/t/timothys/anemoi-house/replay/atmosphere-subsampled/p0/ufs2arco-cache/
  logs: /pscratch/sd/t/timothys/anemoi-house/replay/atmosphere-subsampled/p0/ufs2arco-logs/training
```

## Checking on progress

You can monitor progress by watching the log files generated inside of the
directory specified in the "logs" option noted above.
When it's done you'll get something like:

```
tail -n 1 /pscratch/sd/t/timothys/anemoi-house/replay/atmosphere-subsampled/p0/ufs2arco-logs/training/log.0000.0128.out
[329 s] [INFO   ] ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Dataset is ready for launch at: /pscratch/sd/t/timothys/anemoi-house/replay/atmosphere-subsampled/p0/training.zarr
```

And noting the time, this should take 5-6 minutes or so.
